I learned programminng skills there such as html, css, Javascript for fundamentals, along with Javascript libraries such as React for front end development, and React native for hybrid phone application development. Along with that i gained skills in Back-end using NodeJS and MongoDB. I'm pleased you found my page, and hope you enjoy the site!
